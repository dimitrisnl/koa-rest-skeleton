Hey there 👋.

I couldn't find a basic skeleton for [Koa](https://koajs.com/) that I liked, so I decided to give it a go.

This project sets up `prettier`, `eslint`, `jest` and has accounted for a `DEV` enviroment with `nodemon`.

You won't find a sophisticated folder structure, auth, or any boilerplate that eventually will be removed. Just a pre-configured enviroment to kick-start your project.

## Prerequisites

- node >=12.0.0

## Usage

1. Fork this repo

2. Run `npm install`

3. Configure the routes in `lib/routes` as you please
